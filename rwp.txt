Description:
	A mathematical pendulum driven by a reaction wheel is considered. The force is the voltage applied to the motor driving the wheel. 
The available measurement signals are the angular deflection of the pendulum arm and the angular speed of the motor. 
The forcing signal was Gaussian-distributed noise.
	An example of a nonlinear model is included in point 2 of the attached paper.

Sampling frequency: 100 Hz
Inputs:
	u: normalized voltage signal for DC motor
Outputs:
	y: pendulum arm position
	w: DC motor velocity
Columns:
	Column 1: voltage 		u
